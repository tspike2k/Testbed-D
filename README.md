# Testbed-D

Examples of interesting things that can be done with D

## Description

This is a collection of test programs I wrote to exercise features of the D programming language. None of this code is production ready! Any code in this repository should be viewed merely as a reference point for exploring the capabilities of the language. The files are short and fairly legible, though there are few (if any) comments. Hopefully this will be of use to someone out there!

Note that all the code in this repo was compiled using DMD. LDC and GDC were not tested.
